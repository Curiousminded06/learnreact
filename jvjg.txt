life cycle methods
just like our life...born,learn,death
mount -> birth of component->comp. initial rendered in a DOM
update-> component is being updated
unmount -> components is removed from DOM

*mounting*->
1)constructor-> function-> intially called
2)rendered->Logic ,some more component,merge everything
3) componentDidMount->side effects -> call API ,DOM 



the flow is like...

hook.js:332 hey im from constructor
user.jsx:35 hey i'm from render
2user.jsx:28 hey i'm from component did mount
